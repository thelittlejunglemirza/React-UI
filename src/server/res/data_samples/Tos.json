View the  current version or  all past versions  .  Last modified: April 14, 2014 (  view archived versions  )  ##  Welcome to Google!  Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.  By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.  Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.  ##  Using our Services  You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.  Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.  Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.  Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.  In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.  Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.  ##  Your Google Account  You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.  To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account. Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account,  follow these instructions  .  ##  Privacy and Copyright Protection  Google’s  privacy policies  explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.  We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s policy about responding to notices  in our Help Center  .  ##  Your Content in our Services  Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.  When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.  Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.  If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.  You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.  ##  About Software in our Services  When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.  Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non- exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.  Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.  ##  Modifying and Terminating our Services  We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.  You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.  We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.  ##  Our Warranties and Disclaimers  We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.  OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.  SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.  ##  Liability for our Services  WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, GOOGLE, AND GOOGLE’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).  IN ALL CASES, GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.  ##  Business uses of our Services  If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.  ##  About these Terms  We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.  If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.  These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.  If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).  If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.  The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

          ##  Welcome to Google!

          Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are
          provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
          Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

          By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them
          carefully.

          Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product
          requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be
          available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part
          of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

          ##  Using our Services

          You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

          Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or
          try to access them using a method other than the interface and the
          instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by
          law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.
          We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with
          our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

          Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
          rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from
          our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
          permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding
          or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal
          notices displayed in or along with our Services.

          Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the
          sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review
          content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we
          may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates
          our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review
          content, so please don’t assume that we do.

          In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
          announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out
          of some of those communications.

          Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services
          in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety
          laws.

          ##  Your Google Account

          You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may
          create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you
          by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you
          are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or
          additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or
          disable your account.

          To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are
          responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account.
          Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If
          you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account,  follow
          these instructions  .

          ##  Privacy and Copyright Protection

          Google’s  privacy policies  explain how we treat your personal data and
          protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you
          agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

          We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts
          of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act.

          We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
          property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want
          to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s
          policy about responding to notices  in our Help Center  .

          ##  Your Content in our Services

          Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any
          intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what
          belongs to you stays yours.

          When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Google
          (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce,
          modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations,
          adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with
          our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
          distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the
          limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to
          develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services
          (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some
          Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been
          provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or
          settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those
          Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for
          any content that you submit to our Services.

          If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo,
          and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to
          your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in
          our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We
          will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in
          your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name
          and photo do not appear in an ad.

          You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the
          privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit
          feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or
          suggestions without obligation to you.

          ##  About Software in our Services

          When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may
          update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is
          available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

          Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-
          exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the
          Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and
          enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner
          permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease
          any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or
          attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit
          those restrictions or you have our written permission.

          Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services
          may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to
          you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly
          override some of these terms.

          ##  Modifying and Terminating our Services

          We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove
          functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

          You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see
          you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new
          limits to our Services at any time.

          We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is
          important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will
          give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that
          Service.

          ##  Our Warranties and Disclaimers

          We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and
          care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things
          that we don’t promise about our Services.

          OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER
          GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE
          SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN
          THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY,
          AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.

          SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY
          OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO
          THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.

          ##  Liability for our Services

          WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, GOOGLE, AND GOOGLE’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL
          NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR
          INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

          TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE, AND ITS
          SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR
          ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE
          SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).

          IN ALL CASES, GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE
          FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

          ##  Business uses of our Services

          If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts
          these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates,
          officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or
          related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any
          liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments,
          litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

          ##  About these Terms

          We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to,
          for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
          look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms
          on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
          Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no
          sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing
          new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be
          effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a
          Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

          If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
          additional terms will control for that conflict.

          These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not
          create any third party beneficiary rights.

          If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away,
          this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as
          taking action in the future).

          If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not
          affect any other terms.

          The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules,
          will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the
          Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services
          will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara
          County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction
          in those courts.

          or  all past versions  .

          Last modified: March 1, 2012

          ##  Welcome to Google!

          Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are
          provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
          Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

          By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them
          carefully.

          Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product
          requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be
          available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part
          of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

          ##  Using our Services

          You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

          Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or
          try to access them using a method other than the interface and the
          instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by
          law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.
          We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with
          our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

          Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
          rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from
          our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
          permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding
          or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal
          notices displayed in or along with our Services.

          Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the
          sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review
          content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we
          may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates
          our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review
          content, so please don’t assume that we do.

          In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
          announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out
          of some of those communications.

          ##  Your Google Account

          You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may
          create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you
          by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you
          are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or
          additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or
          disable your account.

          If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or account,  follow
          these instructions  .

          ##  Privacy and Copyright Protection

          Google’s  privacy policies  explain how we treat your personal data and
          protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you
          agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

          We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts
          of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act.

          We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
          property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want
          to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s
          policy about responding to notices  in our Help Center  .

          ##  Your Content in our Services

          Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any
          intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what
          belongs to you stays yours.

          When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Google
          (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce,
          modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations,
          adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with
          our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
          distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the
          limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to
          develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services
          (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some
          Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been
          provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or
          settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those
          Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for
          any content that you submit to our Services.

          You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the
          privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit
          feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or
          suggestions without obligation to you.

          ##  About Software in our Services

          When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may
          update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is
          available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

          Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-
          exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the
          Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and
          enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner
          permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease
          any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or
          attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit
          those restrictions or you have our written permission.

          Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services
          may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to
          you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly
          override some of these terms.

          ##  Modifying and Terminating our Services

          We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove
          functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

          You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see
          you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new
          limits to our Services at any time.

          We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is
          important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will
          give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that
          Service.

          ##  Our Warranties and Disclaimers

          We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and
          care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things
          that we don’t promise about our Services.

          Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither
          Google nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the
          Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within
          the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability,
          availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.

          Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty
          of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To
          the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.

          ##  Liability for our Services

          When permitted by law Google, and Google’s suppliers and distributors, will
          not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or
          indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

          To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Google, and its
          suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for
          any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the
          Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).

          In all cases, Google, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable
          for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable

          We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a
          consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing
          in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which
          may not be waived by contract.

          ##  Business uses of our Services

          If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts
          these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates,
          officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or
          related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any
          liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments,
          litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

          ##  About these Terms

          We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to,
          for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
          look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms
          on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
          Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no
          sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing
          new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be
          effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a
          Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

          If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
          additional terms will control for that conflict.

          These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not
          create any third party beneficiary rights.

          If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away,
          this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as
          taking action in the future).

          If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not
          affect any other terms.

          The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of
          disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law
          is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes
          related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California,
          U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes
          arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the
          courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and
          venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local
          jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms.
          Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the
          services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa
          Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal
          jurisdiction in those courts.

The Google Maps APIs are\na collection of services that allow you to include maps, geocoding, places,\nand other content from Google in your web pages or applications.\n\nLast Updated: January 4, 2018\n\nThis page contains the Google Maps APIs Terms of Service. If you have\nquestions about these terms, please consult the FAQ’s Terms of Service\nsection. These terms do not apply if you have entered into a separate written\nagreement with Google (such as a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan or Google Maps\nAPIs for Work agreement) related to the Google Maps APIs.\n\n## 1\\. Your relationship with Google.\n\n. Your use of any of the Google Maps APIs (referred to in this document as the\n\" Maps API(s) \" or the \" Service \") is subject to the terms of a legal\nagreement between you and Google (the \" Terms \"). \" Google \" means\neither (a) Google Ireland Limited, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow\nStreet, Dublin 4, Ireland, if your billing address is in any country within\nEurope, the Middle East, or Africa (\" EMEA \"); (b) Google Asia Pacific\nPte.

Before you use the Maps API(s), you should read each of the documents comprising the Terms, and print or save a local copy for your records. \n\n. If you use the Maps API(s) in conjunction with any other Google products,\nincluding any other Google API(s), (collectively, the Service and all other\nGoogle products and services are referred to as the \" Google Services \"),\nyour agreement with Google will also include the terms applicable to those\nGoogle Services. All of these are referred to as the \" Additional Terms.\"\nIf Additional Terms apply, they will be accessible to you either within or\nthrough your use of the applicable Google Services. If there is any\ncontradiction between the Additional Terms and the Maps APIs Terms, then the\nMaps APIs Terms will take precedence only as they relate to the Maps API(s),\nand not to any other Google Services.\n\n. If there is any contradiction between the Maps APIs Terms and other Maps\nAPI(s)-related documents (including the Maps APIs Documentation), then the\nMaps APIs Terms will take precedence.\n\n. Google reserves the right to make changes to the Terms from time to time.\nWhen these changes are made, Google will make a new copy of the Terms\navailable at http://developers.google.com/maps/terms (or such other URL as\nGoogle may provide). You understand and agree that if you use the Service\nafter the date on which the Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as\nacceptance of the updated Terms. If a modification is unacceptable to you, you\nmay terminate this agreement by ceasing use of the Maps API(s).\n\n## 2\\. Accepting the Terms.\n\n. In order to use the Maps API(s), you must agree to the Terms by:\n\n  1. clicking to accept the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the Service’s user interface; or \n  2. using the Maps API(s). You understand and agree that Google will treat your use of the Maps API(s) as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards. \n\n. You may not use the Maps API(s) and may not accept the Terms if you are a\nperson barred from using the Service under United States law.\n\n. You represent that you have full power, capacity, and authority to accept\nthese Terms. If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another\nentity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind your employer\nor such entity to these Terms. If you don't have the legal authority to bind,\nplease ensure that an authorized person from your entity consents to and\naccepts these Terms.\n\n## 3\\. Privacy and Personal Information.\n\n. For information about Google's data protection practices, please read\nGoogle's Privacy Policy. This policy explains how Google treats your personal\ninformation and protects your privacy when you use the Service.\n\n. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Google's Privacy\nPolicy.\n\n. You must post and abide by an appropriate privacy policy in your Maps API\nImplementation in accordance with Section 9.3 (End User Terms and Privacy\nPolicy).\n\n. You will comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection of\ninformation from visitors to your Maps API Implementation.\n\n. You and Google agree to the  Google Maps Controller-Controller Data\nProtection Terms.\n\n. You must not provide to Google: (a) any personally identifiable information\nor device identifiers; or (b) any European person’s Personal Data (where\n“European” means “European Economic Area or Switzerland” and “Personal Data”\nhas the meaning provided in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU)\n2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016).\nUsers of your Maps API Implementation may provide information directly to\nGoogle through your Maps API Implementation, as needed.\n\n## 4\\. Provision of the Service by Google.\n\n. Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (\"\nSubsidiaries and Affiliates \"). Sometimes, these companies will be\nproviding the Service to you on behalf of Google itself. You understand and\nagree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Service\nto you.\n\n. You understand and agree that Google may limit the number of transactions\nyou may send or receive through the Service; such fixed upper limits may be\nset by Google at any time, at Google’s discretion. For further information,\nsee Section 10.4(b) below.\n\n.\n\n  1. _In places results_. Google reserves the right to include advertising in the places results provided to you through the Maps API(s). By using the Maps API(s) to obtain places results, you agree to display such advertising in the form provided to you by Google. \n  2. _In maps images_. Google also reserves the right to include advertising in the maps images provided to you through the Maps API(s), subject to the following provisions. In this Section, \"Ads Notice\" means a notice from Google that it will include advertising in a particular Maps API. The Ads Notice may be provided on relevant Google websites, including the  Google Geo Developers Blog (or such other URL as Google may provide) and the applicable Google Maps API Groups. \n    1. _New Maps API(s) and major version upgrades of existing Maps API(s) launched with an Ads Notice_. A \"major version\" of a Maps API is denoted by a new \"whole number\" in the version name (for example, a \"major version\" change occurs if API v4.5 is replaced by v5.0). By using the maps images in these new or major version upgrades of the Maps API(s), you agree to display the advertising included in those maps images in the form provided to you by Google. \n    2. _Maps API(s) and major version upgrades of existing Maps API(s) launched without an Ads Notice_. For any Maps API that Google has launched (or launches in the future) without an Ads Notice, Google will not include advertising in that API’s maps images unless Google provides you with an Ads Notice at least 90 days beforehand (the \"Ads Notice Period\"). \n    3. _Maps API Implementations that incorporated the Maps API(s) before April 8, 2011_. If your Maps API Implementation incorporated a major version of a Maps API before April 8, 2011, you have a limited right to opt out of advertising in the maps images provided through that major version of that Maps API by providing written notice to Google during the Ads Notice Period; your notice must state that you refuse to accept advertising in the maps images and must be provided to Google in accordance with Google's notice requirements (as specified in Google's Ads Notice). \n  3. _Opting out of ads_. You may at any time opt out of advertising in the places results and the maps images by either: \n    1. contacting the  Google Maps sales team to obtain a Google enterprise license; or \n    2. terminating your use of the Service. \n  4. _Indexing and caching for ads serving_. By using an API that serves ads, you give Google the right to access, index, and cache the web pages or applications that contain your Maps API Implementation. \n\n. The following is the Service’s \"Deprecation Policy\":\n\n  1. Google will announce if it intends to remove major features from, or discontinue, an API or the Service. \n  2. Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those Google Maps API versions and features identified at  http://developers.google.com/maps/maps-api-list without these changes until one year after the announcement, unless Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that: \n    1. it is required by law or third-party relationship (including changes in law or relationships) to make those changes earlier; or \n    2. doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden. \n\n## 5\\. Your Google Account.\n\n. In order to access the Service, you must have and maintain a Google Account\nin good standing. You must ensure that any information you give to Google in\nconnection with your Google Account or the Service will always be accurate,\ncorrect, and up to date.\n\n.

You\nmust notify Google immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of\nyour password; your Google Account; or any unique identifier that Google\nrequires you to use, such as an API Key or client ID (a \" Developer\nIdentifier \").\n\n## 6\\. Google’s Proprietary Rights.\n\nYou understand and agree that Google and its licensors and their suppliers (as\napplicable) own all legal right, title, and interest in and to the Service and\nContent, including any intellectual property rights in the Service and Content\n(whether those rights are registered or not, and wherever in the world those\nrights may exist).\n\n## 7\\. Permitted Uses.\n\nYou will use the Service only for purposes that:\n\n  1. are permitted by the Terms (including the Licenses in Section 8); \n  2. are permitted by any applicable law or third-party contract in the relevant jurisdictions; and \n  3. comply with all applicable policies or guidelines made available by Google, including in the Maps APIs Documentation and the  Permission Guidelines for Google Maps and Google Earth. \n\n## 8\\. Licenses from Google to You.\n\n.\n\n  1. \" Brand Features \" means trade names, trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. \n  2. \" Content \" means any content provided through the Service (whether created by Google or its third-party licensors), including map and terrain data, imagery, traffic data, and places data (including business listings). \n  3. \" Maps API Implementation \" means a software application, website, or other implementation that uses the Maps API(s) to obtain and display Content in conjunction with Your Content. \n  4. \" Your Content \" means any content that you provide in your Maps API Implementation, including data, images, video, or software.

During and after the Term, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you will not challenge or assist others to challenge Google’s Brand Features (or their registration by Google), and you will not attempt to register any Brand Features (including domain names) that are confusingly similar to Google’s in any way (including in sound, appearance, or spelling). \n\n. You will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices\n(including copyright and trademark notices, Terms of Use links, or Brand\nFeatures) displayed or provided through the Service.

License Requirements.\n\nGoogle’s licenses above are subject to your compliance with the following\nrequirements:\n\n.\n\n9.1.1 General Rules.\n\n  1. _Free access (no fees)_. Subject to Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions), your Maps API Implementation must be accessible to the general public without charge and must not require a fee-based subscription or other fee-based restricted access. This rule applies to Your Content and any other content in your Maps API Implementation, whether Your Content or the other content exists now or is added later. \n  2. _Public access (no firewall)_. Your Maps API Implementation must not operate (i) only behind a firewall; or (ii) only on an internal network (except during the development and testing phase); or (iii) in a closed community (for example, through invitation-only access). \n\n9.1.2 Exceptions.\n\n  1. _Enterprise agreement with Google_. The rules in Section 9.1.1 (Free access, Public access) do not apply if you have entered into a separate written agreement with Google (such as a  Google Maps agreement) or obtained Google's written permission. \n  2. _Mobile applications_. \n    1. The rule in Section 9.1.1(a) (Free access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation is used in a mobile application that is sold for a fee through an online store and is downloadable to a mobile device that can access the online store. \n    2. The rule in Section 9.1.1(b) (Public access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation is an Android application that uses the Google Maps Android API. (However, the rule in Section 9.1.1(b) (Public access) will continue to apply if your Maps API Implementation is an Android application that uses any other Maps APIs, unless the Maps API Implementation qualifies for the exception in Section 9.1.2(a) (Enterprise agreement with Google).) \n\n9.1.3 Examples.\n\n  1. You can require users to log in to your Maps API Implementation if you do not require users to pay a fee. \n  2. You can charge a fee for your Maps API Implementation if it is an Android application downloadable to mobile devices from the Google Play Store. \n  3. If you are a consultant who creates or hosts Maps API Implementations for third-party customers, you may charge those customers a fee for your consulting or hosting services (but not for the Maps API Implementations themselves, except as permitted under Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions)). \n\n. You must implement those reporting mechanisms that Google requires (as\nupdated from time to time in these Terms and in the Maps APIs Documentation).\n\n. If you develop a Maps API Implementation for use by other users, you must:\n\n  1. display to the users of your Maps API Implementation the link to Google’s Terms of Service as presented through the Service or described in the Maps APIs Documentation; \n  2. explicitly state in your Maps API Implementation’s terms of use that, by using your Maps API Implementation, your users are agreeing to be bound by Google’s Terms of Service; and \n  3. protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. \n    1. _Your privacy policy_. You must make publicly available, and must abide by, an appropriate privacy policy in your Maps API Implementation. In particular, if your Maps API Implementation enables you or any party to gain access to information about users of the Maps API(s), including personally identifiable information (such as user names) or non-personally identifiable usage information (such as location), your privacy policy must describe your use and retention of this information. \n      1. _Geolocation privacy_\n        1. Your Maps API Implementation must notify the user in advance of the type(s) of data that you intend to collect from the user or the user’s device. Your Maps API Implementation must not obtain or cache any user’s location in any manner except with the user's prior consent. Your Maps API Implementation must let the user revoke the user's consent at any time. \n        2. If your Maps API Implementation provides Google with geolocation data, that geolocation data must not enable Google to identify an individual user. For example, if your Maps API Implementation sends Google Your Content, and Your Content includes geolocation data, Your Content must not also include unique device identifiers associated with individual users. \n        3. If you intend to obtain the user’s location and use it with any other data provider's data, you must disclose this fact to the user. \n      2. _Google’s Privacy Policy_. Your privacy policy must notify users that you are using the Maps API(s) and incorporate by reference Google’s Privacy Policy by including a link to Google’s then-current Privacy Policy (at  http://www.google.com/policies/privacy or such other URL as Google may provide). \n      3. _Cookies_. As noted in the Documentation, certain Maps API(s) store and access cookies and other information on end users’ devices. If you use any of these cookie-enabled Maps API(s) in your Maps API Implementation, then for end users in the European Union, you must comply with the  EU User Consent Policy. \n\n.\n\n  1. Content provided to you through the Service may contain the Brand Features of Google, its strategic partners, or other third-party rights holders of content that Google indexes. When Google provides those Brand Features or other attribution through the Service, you must display such attribution as provided (or as described in the Maps APIs Documentation) and must not delete or alter the attribution. \n  2. You must conspicuously display the \"powered by Google\" attribution (and any other attribution(s) required by Google in the  Maps APIs Documentation) on or adjacent to the relevant Service search box and Google search results. If you use the standard Google search control, or the standard Google search control form, this attribution will be included automatically, and you must not modify or obscure this automatically-generated attribution. \n  3. You understand and agree that Google has the sole right and discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) are in compliance with the above requirements. \n\n. You will use all reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized use of the\nService and to terminate any such unauthorized use.\n\n. You are solely responsible for (and Google has no responsibility to you or\nany third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for\nthe consequences of any such breach (including any loss or damage that Google\nmay suffer).\n\n## 10\\. License Restrictions.\n\nExcept as expressly permitted under the Terms, or unless you have received\nprior written authorization from Google (or, as applicable, from the\nparticular Content provider), Google’s licenses above are conditioned on your\nadherence to all of the restrictions below. In this Section 10, the phrase\n\"you will not\" means \"when using the Service, you will not, and will not\npermit a third party to.\"\n\n.\n\n  1. _No access to APIs or Content except through the Service_. You will not access the Maps API(s) or the Content except through the Service. For example, you must not access map tiles or imagery through interfaces or channels (including undocumented Google interfaces) other than the Maps API(s). \n  2. _No access to Service without applicable Developer Identifier(s)_. For certain versions or features of the Maps API(s), Google may require you to use a Developer Identifier to access and administer the Service. If a Developer Identifier is required under the Maps APIs Documentation, you will not access the Service without the Developer Identifier. \n  3. _No hiding identity_. You will not hide from Google the identity of your Maps API Implementation. You must follow the identification conventions in the Maps APIs Documentation. \n\n. The following restrictions apply generally to all Google Services, including\nthe Google application programming interfaces at\nhttps://developers.google.com/products/ (or such other URL as Google may\nprovide) (the “ Google API(s) ”). You will not:\n\n  1. Sublicense a Google API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API client that functions substantially the same as the Google APIs and offer it for use by third parties. \n  2. Perform an action with the intent of introducing to Google Services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature. \n  3. Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others. \n  4. Interfere with or disrupt the Google APIs or the servers or networks providing the Google APIs. \n  5. Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements. \n  6. Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any Google API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. \n  7. Use the Google APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the Google APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems). \n  8. Use the Google APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State. \n  9. Remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service, or any links to or notices of those terms. \n\n.\n\n  1. _No violation of Google’s Software Principles_. You will not violate Google’s Software Principles at  http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/software-principles.html (or such other URLs that Google may designate). \n  2. _No modification of search results_. You will not modify, reorder, augment, or manipulate search results in any way unless you explicitly notify the end user of your actions. \n\n.\n\n  1. _No use except under these Terms_. You will not use the Service or Content except as expressly permitted under these Terms. For example: \n    1. _No fees_. You will not charge any third party a fee to use your Maps API Implementation, the Service, or the Content, unless you have purchased an applicable Google Maps APIs Premium Plan or Google Maps APIs for Work license that expressly permits this use. \n    2. _No printing 5,000+ copies for direct marketing_. You will not print more than 5,000 copies of sales collateral materials containing a screenshot of the Content for purposes of commercial sales lead generation. \n    3. _No use as a core part of printed matter_. You will not incorporate the Content as a core part of printed matter (such as a printed map or guide book) that is redistributed for a fee. \n  2. _No use beyond transaction limits and usage policies_. If your Maps API Implementation generates a high volume of transactions, Google reserves the right to set transaction limits, as described in the Maps APIs Documentation here. Google also reserves the right to set other usage policies in the Documentation from time to time. If you want to engage in use outside these transaction limits or usage policies, you can purchase more usage capacity through the Maps API Standard pricing plan, or you can contact the  Google Maps sales team for licensing options to address your needs. Google may decline your request, or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use. \n  3. _Restrictions on your Maps API Implementations_. \n    1. _No creation of a substitute service_. You will not use the Service to create a Maps API Implementation that is a substitute for, or substantially similar service to, Google Maps (at  https://www.google.com/maps (or such other URL as Google may provide)) (\" Google Maps \") or the Service. \n    2. _No creation or augmentation of data sets based on Google’s Content or Services_. You will not use Google’s Content or Services to create or augment your own mapping-related dataset (or that of a third party), including a mapping or navigation dataset, business listings database, mailing list, or telemarketing list. \n    3. _No navigation_. You will not use the Service or Content for or in connection with (a) real-time navigation or route guidance; or (b) automatic or autonomous vehicle control. \n    4. _No asset-tracking unless you have purchased the applicable enterprise license_. Unless you have purchased an applicable Premium Plan or Maps APIs for Work license that expressly permits you to do so, you will not use the Service or Content for commercial asset-tracking or in Maps API Implementations whose primary purpose is to assess vehicle insurance risks. \n      1. Commercial asset-tracking includes dispatch, fleet management, and Maps API Implementations that track your (or your end users’) assets (for example, private or commercial transportation applications, including taxi and vehicle-for-hire applications). \n      2. Non-commercial asset-tracking implementations include applications used for a non-commercial purpose (for example, a free, publicly accessible Maps API Implementation that displays real-time public transit or other transportation status information or that allows end users to share real-time location with others). \n    5. _No use of Content in a listings service_. You will not use business listings-related Content in any Customer Implementation that has the primary purpose of making available business, residential address, or telephone directory listings. \n    6. _No use of Content for an Ads product_. You will not use business listings-related Content to create or augment an advertising product. \n  4. _No use of Content without a Google map_. Unless the Maps APIs Documentation expressly permits you to do so, you will not use the Content in a Maps API Implementation without a corresponding Google map. For example, you may display Street View imagery without a corresponding Google map because the Maps APIs Documentation expressly permits this use. \n  5. _No use of Content with a non-Google map_. You must not use the Content in a Maps API Implementation that contains a non-Google map. \n\n.\n\n  1. _No distribution or sale except as permitted under the Terms_. You will not distribute, sell, or otherwise make any part of the Service available to third parties except as permitted by these Terms. \n  2. _No derivative works_. You will not modify or create a derivative work based on any Content unless expressly permitted to do so under these Terms. For example, the following are prohibited: (i) creating server-side modification of map tiles; (ii) stitching multiple static map images together to display a map that is larger than permitted in the Maps APIs Documentation; or (iii) tracing or copying the copyrightable elements of Google’s maps or building outlines and creating a new work, such as a new mapping or navigation dataset. \n  3. _No use of Content outside the Service_. You will not use any Content outside of the Service except as expressly permitted to do so in Subsection (d). For example, you will not export or save the Content to a third party’s platform or service. \n  4. _No caching or storage_. You will not pre-fetch, cache, index, or store any Content to be used outside the Service, except that you may store limited amounts of Content solely for the purpose of improving the performance of your Maps API Implementation due to network latency (and not for the purpose of preventing Google from accurately tracking usage), and only if such storage: \n    1. is temporary (and in no event more than 30 calendar days); \n    2. is secure; \n    3. does not manipulate or aggregate any part of the Content or Service; and \n    4. does not modify attribution in any way. \n  5. _No mass downloading_. You will not use the Service in a manner that gives you or a third party access to mass downloads or bulk feeds of any Content. For example, you are not permitted to offer a batch geocoding service that uses Content contained in the Maps API(s). \n  6. _No incorporating Google software into other software_. You will not incorporate any software provided as part of the Service into other software. \n  7. _No removing, obscuring, or altering terms of service, links, or proprietary rights notices_. You will not: \n    1. remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms, or any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or \n    2. falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material. \n\n. We want to make sure that the Services remain online and available for all\nusers. To help ensure this, during the agreement term, you will not try to\nshut down the Services that you have been using by seeking an injunction or\nexclusion order.\n\n## 11\\. Licenses from You to Google.\n\n. Google claims no ownership over Your Content, and you retain copyright and\nany other rights you already hold in Your Content. By submitting or displaying\nYour Content through the Service, you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable,\nnon-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use Your\nContent solely for the following purposes:\n\n  1. enabling Google to provide you with the Service; \n  2. if you opt to do so through your Maps API Implementation’s features, allowing end users to use Your Content in Google Services; and \n  3. if you opt to submit Your Content through the Google Places API(s), allowing Google to use that content in Google Services. \n\n. During the term of this agreement, you give Google a non-exclusive,\nworldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use Your Brand Features and\nYour Content to publicize or advertise that you are using the Service (for\nexample, by using your marks in presentations, marketing materials, customer\nlists, financial reports, and website listings (including links to your\nwebsite), or by creating marketing or advertising materials that show\nscreenshots of the Service in which Your Content is featured).\n\n. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority\nnecessary to grant the above licenses.\n\n## 12\\. Maps API Standard Pricing Plan and Payment Terms.\n\nThis Section 12 applies if you purchase usage capacity (beyond the Service’s\ntransaction limits) through the Maps API Standard pricing plan:\n\n. Certain parts of the Service are provided to you without charge up to the\ntransaction limits described in the Maps APIs Documentation here.\n\n. Google will issue an electronic bill to you for all charges accrued above\nthe transaction limits based on your use of the Service during the previous\nmonth. You will pay all fees specified in the invoice, including the invoice’s\nspecified currency and payment terms. Google’s measurement of your use of the\nService is final.\n\n. In association with your purchase of Maps API usage, you are responsible for\nall applicable government-imposed taxes, except for taxes based on Google’s\nnet income, net worth, employment, and assets (including personal and real\nproperty) (\" Taxes \"), and you will pay Google for the Service without any\nreduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes\nwill be invoiced to you, unless you provide Google with a timely and valid tax\nexemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some\nstates the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale\nand must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale.\n\n. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to\nfees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any\nof your rights with your credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at Google’s\ndiscretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in\nthese Terms obligates Google to extend credit to any party.\n\n. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the\nhighest rate permitted by law, if less). Google reserves the right to suspend\nyour access to the Service for any late payments.\n\n## 13\\. Terminating this Agreement.\n\nThe Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as\ndescribed below.\n\nYou may terminate your legal agreement with Google by removing the Maps API(s)\ncode from your Maps API Implementation and discontinuing your use of the\nService at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Google when you\nstop using the Service.\n\nGoogle reserves the right to terminate these Terms or discontinue the Service,\nor any portion or feature of the Service, for any reason and at any time\nwithout liability or other obligation to you, except as described under\nSection 4.4 (Changes to the Service; Deprecation Policy).\n\nNothing in this Section 13 will affect Google’s rights under Section 4\n(Provision of Service by Google).\n\nWhen this legal agreement comes to an end, those Terms that by their nature\nare intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including\nSections 3.5 (European Data Protection Terms); 6 (Google’s Proprietary\nRights); 11.1 (Content License); 13.4 and 13.5 (Terminating this Agreement);\n14 (Exclusion of Warranties); 15 (Limitations of Liability); 16 (Indemnities);\nand 19 (General Legal Terms).\n\n## 14\\. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES.\n\nNOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 14 AND 15, WILL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT\nGOOGLE’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR\nLIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF\nCERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY\nFOR CERTAIN TYPES OF LOSS OR DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS THAT\nARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU, AND GOOGLE’S LIABILITY WILL\nBE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\nYOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND THE\nCONTENT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICE AND THE CONTENT ARE PROVIDED\n\"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE.\" IN PARTICULAR, GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND\nAFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT\nTO YOU THAT:\n\n  1. THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; \n  2. THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; \n  3. THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; AND \n  4. DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED. \n\nANY CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE GOOGLE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND\nRISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM\nOR OTHER DEVICE, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR INJURY THAT RESULTS FROM\nDOWNLOADING OR USING ANY SUCH CONTENT.\n\nNO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM\nGOOGLE, OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE OR CONTENT, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY\nNOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.\n\nGOOGLE, ITS LICENSORS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL\nWARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n## 15\\. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.\n\nSUBJECT TO SECTION 14.1, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE\nMAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND\nAFFILIATES, AND GOOGLE'S LICENSORS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO\nYOU FOR:\n\n  1. ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, COMMON LAW, OR STATUTORY DAMAGES); ANY LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY); ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION; ANY LOSS OF DATA; ANY COST TO PROCURE SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; OR ANY INTANGIBLE LOSS; OR \n  2. ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF: \n    1. ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY RELATIONSHIP OR TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ADVERTISER OR SPONSOR WHOSE ADVERTISING APPEARS ON GOOGLE SERVICES; \n    2. ANY CHANGES THAT GOOGLE MAY MAKE TO THE SERVICE, OR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY DISCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE (OR ANY FEATURES WITHIN THE SERVICE); \n    3. THE DELETION OR CORRUPTION OF, OR FAILURE TO STORE, ANY CONTENT AND OTHER DATA MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY OR THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE; \n    4. YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE GOOGLE WITH ACCURATE ACCOUNT INFORMATION; OR \n    5. YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL. \n\nTHE LIMITATIONS ON GOOGLE’S LIABILITY IN SECTION 15.1 ABOVE WILL APPLY WHETHER\nOR NOT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR THEIR SUPPLIERS HAVE\nBEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH\nLOSSES OR DAMAGES.\n\n## 16\\. Indemnities.\n\nYou will defend and indemnify Google and its affiliates, directors, officers,\nemployees, strategic partners, licensors, and their suppliers (the \"\nIndemnified Parties \") against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs,\nfees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-\nparty legal proceeding to the extent arising from:\n\n  1. your use of the Service or the Content in breach of the Terms or applicable policies; \n  2. your Maps API Implementation, including any claim that your Maps API Implementation infringes a third party’s rights or violates applicable law; or \n  3. Your Content. \n\nYou will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any\nallegation or third-party legal proceeding. Google reserves the right, at its\nown expense, to assume the exclusive control and defense of any indemnified\nmatter under this Section 16.\n\n## 17\\. Copyright Policies; Content Removal; Termination of Repeat Offenders’\nAccounts.\n\nIt is Google’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement\nthat comply with applicable international intellectual property law\n(including, in the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and to\nterminate the accounts of repeat offenders. Details of Google’s policy can be\nfound here.\n\n## 18\\. Other Content.\n\nThe Service may include hyperlinks to other websites or content or resources.\nGoogle has no control over any websites or resources that are provided by\ncompanies or persons other than Google. You understand and agree that Google\nis not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or\nresources, and does not endorse any advertising, products, or other materials\non, or available from, such websites or resources.\n\nYou understand and agree that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that\nyou may incur as a result of the availability of those external sites or\nresources, or as a result of any reliance by you on the completeness,\naccuracy, or existence of any advertising, products, or other materials on, or\navailable from, such websites or resources.\n\n## 19\\. General Legal Terms.\n\n. Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to\nthe Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service.\n\n. Google may assign any part of this agreement without written consent.\n\n. Google will not be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or\ndelaying the exercise of) any rights under these Terms. A waiver will be\neffective only if Google expressly states in a writing signed by an authorized\nrepresentative that Google is waiving a specified Term.\n\n. Google’s affiliates and the Indemnified Parties are third-party\nbeneficiaries to the Terms and are entitled to directly enforce, and rely on,\nany Terms that confer a right or benefit to them. There are no other third-\nparty beneficiaries to the Terms.\n\n. These Terms set out all terms agreed between the parties and supersede all\nother agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.\n\n. If any term (or part of a term) of these Terms is invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect.\n\n.

By accessing or using our APIs, you are\nagreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and\nadditional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control\nfor that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional\nterms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable\npolicies and guidelines as the \"Terms.\" You agree to comply with the Terms and\nthat the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms\ncarefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with\nother Google products or services, then the terms for those other products or\nservices also apply.\n\nUnder the Terms, \"Google\" means Google Inc., with offices at 1600 Amphitheatre\nParkway, Mountain View, California 94043, United States, unless set forth\notherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to\n\"Google\" as \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\" in the Terms.\n\n## Section 1: Account and Registration\n\n### a. Accepting the Terms\n\nYou may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of\nlegal age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) you are a person\nbarred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the\nUnited States or other countries including the country in which you are\nresident or from which you use the APIs.\n\n### b. Entity Level Acceptance\n\nIf you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant\nthat you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the\nTerms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to \"you\"\nin the Terms refer to that entity).\n\n### c. Registration\n\nIn order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain\ninformation (such as identification or contact details) as part of the\nregistration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the\nAPIs. Any registration information you give to Google will always be accurate\nand up to date and you'll inform us promptly of any updates.\n\n### d. Subsidiaries and Affiliates\n\nGoogle has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. These\ncompanies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of Google and the Terms will\nalso govern your relationship with these companies.\n\n## Section 2: Using Our APIs\n\n### a. Your End Users\n\nYou will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them\nto violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.\n\n### b. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other Google Terms of\nService\n\nYou will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights\n(including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or\nsoftware, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or\npromote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not\nviolate any other terms of service with Google (or its affiliates).\n\n### c. Permitted Access\n\nYou will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in\nthe documentation of that API. If Google assigns you developer credentials\n(e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not\nmisrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when\nusing the APIs or developer accounts.\n\n### d. API Limitations\n\nGoogle sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the\nnumber of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may\nserve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to\ncircumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to\nuse any API beyond these limits, you must obtain Google's express consent (and\nGoogle may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to\nadditional terms and/or charges for that use).

Open Source Software\n\nSome of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under\nan open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate\nwritten agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the\ndocumentation. To the limited extent the open source software license\nexpressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth\nyour agreement with Google for the applicable open source software.\n\n### f. Communication with Google\n\nWe may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the\nAPIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about\nopting out of certain types of communication.\n\n### g.

YOU AGREE THAT GOOGLE MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE\nQUALITY, IMPROVE GOOGLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH\nTHE TERMS. This monitoring may include Google accessing and using your API\nClient, for example to identify security issues that could affect Google or\nits users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Google may use any\ntechnical means to overcome such interference. Google may suspend access to\nthe APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe\nthat you are in violation of the Terms.\n\n### b. Security\n\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information\ncollected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information\n(\"PII\"), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your\nusers any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent\nrequired by applicable law.\n\n### c.

API Prohibitions\n\nWhen using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):\n\n  1. Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.\n  2.

Use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.\n  9. Remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in writing by Google, Google does not intend use of\nthe APIs to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, as amended (\"HIPAA\"), and makes no representations that\nthe APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a \"covered entity\"\nor \"business associate\" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any\npurpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information\nto Google unless you have received prior written consent to such use from\nGoogle.\n\n### b.

Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.\n  2. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Google confidential information. Google confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances.

However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use\r\n(e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such\r\nService has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such\r\npaid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.\r\n\r\n###  2.3 Payment\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your\r\npayment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are\r\nadded to our prices.\r\n\r\nWe don't guarantee refunds.\r\n\r\nIf you buy any of our paid Services (\u201cPremium Services\u201d), you agree to pay us\r\nthe applicable fees and taxes and to  additional terms  specific to the paid\r\nServices. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your\r\npaid Services.

To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to  cancel or suspend  your Premium Services. \r\n  * All of your purchases of Services are subject to LinkedIn\u2019s refund policy. \r\n  * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase. \r\n\r\nYou can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings\r\nunder \u201c  Purchase History  \u201d.\r\n\r\n###  2.4 Notices and Service Messages\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re okay with us providing notices to you through our websites, apps, and\r\ncontact information your provided to us.

You agree to\r\nkeep your  contact information  up to date.\r\n\r\nPlease review your settings to  control and limit  the messages you receive\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\n###  2.5 Sharing\r\n\r\nWhen you share information, others can see, copy and use that information.\r\n\r\nOur Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as\r\nyour profile, slide deck, links to news articles, job postings, InMails and\r\nblogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other\r\nMembers or Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the\r\nchoices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message\r\ncontent to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections,\r\nrestricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to\r\nnotify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities,\r\nwe default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So if you\r\napply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested\r\nin a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.\r\n\r\nWe are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and\r\ncan remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.\r\n\r\n##  3\\.

If the court cannot do\r\nthat, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and\r\nstill enforce the rest of this Contract. To the extent allowed by law, the\r\nEnglish language version of this Contract is binding and other translations\r\nare for convenience only. This Contract (including additional terms that may\r\nbe provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only\r\nagreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior\r\nagreements for the Services.\r\n\r\nIf we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that\r\nLinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or\r\ntransfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone\r\nwithout our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract\r\nto its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.

How We Share Information\n\n###  3.1 Our Services\n\nAny information you include on your profile and any content you post or social\naction (e.g. likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will\nbe seen by others.\n\n####  Profile\n\nYour profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. As\ndetailed in our  Help Center  , your settings, degree of connection with the\nviewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their  usage of our Services\n, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the\navailability of your profile and certain fields.\n\n####  Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages\n\nOur Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts,\nfollows, likes and comments.\n\n  * When you share a post (e.g., an update, video or blog), the default (which you can  change  ) is to share it publicly. Others who are not your connections will be able to find (including through search engines) and see your post. \n  * When you like, comment on or share another\u2019s post, others will see it, including the person who initiated the post. \n  * In a  group  , posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile unless you change the default  settings  . \n  * Any information you share through companies\u2019 or other organizations\u2019 pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages. \n  * When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that \u201cpage owner\u201d as a follower. We provide aggregate insights about the followers and viewers to the respective page owners. \n  * We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your  settings  where applicable. \n\nYour employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g.\nas a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them\nyour job searches or personal messages.\n\n####  Enterprise Accounts\n\nYour employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as\nRecruiter, Sales Navigator, Elevate, Referrals, Lookup or our advertising\nCampaign Manager. They can also buy access for you to our online learning\nproducts. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise\nServices.\n\nDepending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask\nfor permission to share relevant data from your profile or use of our non-\nenterprise Services. For example, users of  Sales Navigator  will be asked to\nshare their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score  calculated  in part based on\ntheir personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as\njob hunting and personal messages are sensitive and so we do not share those\nwith your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our\nServices (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or\nmention your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).\n\n###  3.2 Communication Archival\n\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance,\nto archive their communications and social media activity, and will use\nservices of others to provide these archival services. We enable such\narchiving outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to\narchive communications with her clients through our Services in order to\nmaintain her professional financial advisor license.\n\n###  3.3 Others\u2019 Services\n\nYou may link your account with others\u2019 services so that they can look up your\ncontacts\u2019 profiles or post your shares on such platforms.\n\nSubject to your preference, other services may look-up your profile.\n\nWhen you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will\nbecome available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be\ndescribed in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the\naccounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share\ncontent from our Services into these other services, or your email provider\nmay give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service.\nYou may  revoke  the link with such accounts.\n\nSubject to your  settings  , (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar\napplications that show a user a \u201cmini\u201d LinkedIn profile of the person they are\nmeeting or messaging, social media , talent and lead managers). \u201cOld\u201d profile\ninformation remains on these services until they update their data cache with\nchanges you made to your profile.\n\n###  3.4 Related Services\n\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn-affiliated\nentities.\n\nWe will share your personal data with our to provide and develop our Services.\nWe combine information internally across the different Services covered by\nthis Privacy Policy. For example, SlideShare will recommend better content to\nyou based on your LinkedIn profile or the articles you read on Pulse, and\nLinkedIn could personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your\nlearning video history, because we are able to identify you across different\nServices using cookies or similar technologies.\n\n###  3.5 Service Providers\n\nWe may use others to help us with our Services.\n\nWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis,\naudit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development).
